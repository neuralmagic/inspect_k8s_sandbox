## Values

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| additionalResources | list | `[]` | A list of additional resources to deploy within the agent environment. They're passed through the Helm template engine. String values are passed through the template engine then converted to YAML. |
| allowCIDR | list | Empty list (no additional CIDR ranges compared to default policies) | A list of CIDR ranges (e.g. 1.1.1.1/32) that pods within the agent environment are allowed to access. |
| allowDomains | list | Empty list (no internet access) | Domains the agent environment may reach. Egress is restricted to ports 80/443 and the request identity must match an entry (TLS SNI on 443, HTTP Host on 80). Use allowDomainsPorts to open other ports. Wildcard entries require Cilium >= 1.18. |
| allowDomainsPorts | list | Empty list (only 80/443 are reachable on allowedDomains) | Extra ports opened to the domains in `allowDomains`, as a list of {port, protocol, domain}. `protocol` defaults to ANY (TCP+UDP) and `domain` (optional) scopes the port to one allowDomains entry. If `domain` is not included, it will apply to all allowed domains. |
| allowEntities | list | Empty list (no additional entities compared to default policies) | A list of Cilium entities (e.g. "world") that pods within the agent environment are allowed to access. |
| annotations | object | `{}` | A dict of annotations to apply to resources within the agent environment. |
| automountServiceAccountToken | bool | `false` | Whether to mount the selected ServiceAccount's Kubernetes API token in sandbox pods. Keep disabled for cloud workload identity such as IRSA, which injects a provider-specific token separately. |
| containerSecurityContext | object | restricted-compliant: non-root, no privilege escalation, all capabilities dropped, RuntimeDefault seccomp | Default securityContext applied to each service's main container when `networkPolicyProvider` is `ovn`, so Pods satisfy the PodSecurity `restricted` profile enforced by OpenShift-style clusters. A per-service `securityContext` is merged over this and wins on conflict. Not applied for `cilium`. Set to `{}` to disable (e.g. for images that must run as root, which `restricted` forbids). |
| corednsCommand | list | `["/coredns","-conf","/etc/coredns/Corefile"]` | The command to use for the coredns container. |
| corednsImage | string | `"coredns/coredns:1.14.6@sha256:900f9c109f7a33545d3c811516e8376df9019147b750f5ce3e254468769176ea"` | The image to use for the coredns container. Pinned by digest; the tag is recorded alongside it for readability and the two must be updated together. An override must run under `corednsSecurityContext` below, or that must be overridden too. |
| corednsSecurityContext | object | Non-root 65532, read-only root filesystem, RuntimeDefault seccomp, no privilege escalation, and no capability other than `NET_BIND_SERVICE` | Security context for the coredns container. Override only if a custom `corednsImage` cannot run under the hardened default. On the `ovn` path the `runAsUser`/`runAsGroup` (65532) are dropped so OpenShift's `restricted-v2` SCC can assign a UID from the namespace's allocated range (a pinned out-of-range UID is rejected at admission); the remaining hardening, including `NET_BIND_SERVICE`, is kept. |
| global | object | set by inspect | The name of the agent environment, only overwrite in cases where e.g. name lengths are causing failures. |
| imagePullSecrets | list | `[]` | References to pre-existing secrets that contain registry credentials. |
| labels | object | `{}` | A dict of labels to apply to resources within the agent environment. |
| networkPolicyProvider | string | ovn | Which network policy engine to render. `cilium` emits `CiliumNetworkPolicy` resources and gives the full guarantees documented below (domain-pinned egress, DNS-query filtering, TLS SNI / HTTP Host identity, ICMP rules). `ovn` emits plain `networking.k8s.io/v1 NetworkPolicy` for clusters without Cilium (e.g. OVN-Kubernetes / OpenShift). Plain NetworkPolicy is L3/L4 only: `allowDomains` degrades to broad egress on common web ports (no domain restriction), DNS lookups are not filtered, and per-port services do not get separate ICMP allowances. See docs/security/network-access.md. |
| networks | object | `{}` | Defines network names that can be attached to services in order to specify subsets of services that can communicate with one another. Names must be lower case alphanumeric with `-` or `.`, and at most 55 characters. |
| serviceAccountCreate | bool | `false` | Whether to create the selected ServiceAccount. Keep disabled to use an externally managed ServiceAccount across concurrent sandbox releases. |
| serviceAccountName | string | `nil` | Service account name for sandbox pods. The account must already exist unless `serviceAccountCreate` is enabled. |
| services | object | see [values.yaml](./values.yaml) | A collection of services to deploy within the agent environment. A service can connect to another service using DNS, e.g. `http://nginx:80`. |
| services.default | object | see [values.yaml](./values.yaml) | The default service, this is required for the agent environment to function. |
| services.default.additionalDnsRecords | list | `[]` | A list of additional domains which will resolve to this service from within the agent environment (e.g. example.com). If one or more records are provided, `dnsRecord` is automatically set to true. Records may contain letters, digits and `_ - .`; whitespace and other characters are rejected at install time because these are interpolated into the CoreDNS Corefile. |
| services.default.args | list | `[]` | The container's entrypoint arguments. |
| services.default.command | list | `["tail","-f","/dev/null"]` | The container's entrypoint command. |
| services.default.dnsRecord | bool | false | Whether to create a DNS record which will resolve to this service from within the agent environment, using the service name as the domain (e.g. default). |
| services.default.env | list | `[]` | Environment variables that will be set in the container. |
| services.default.image | string | `"python:3.12-bookworm"` | The container's image name. |
| services.default.imagePullPolicy | string | `nil` | The container's image pull policy. |
| services.default.initContainers | list | `[]` | Init containers to run before the main container starts. Useful for waiting for dependencies to become ready (e.g., database connectivity checks). Each init container supports: `name` (required), `image` (required), `command`, `args`, `imagePullPolicy`, `workingDir`, `resources`, and `securityContext`. The `$AGENT_ENV` environment variable is automatically injected. Note: init containers cannot reliably access external domains from `allowDomains` due to CoreDNS starting after init containers complete. |
| services.default.livenessProbe | object | `{}` | A probe which is used to determine when to restart a container. |
| services.default.nodeSelector | object | `{}` | Node selector settings for the Pod. |
| services.default.ports | list | `[]` | Deprecated. All ports of services with a DNS record are accessible (though not necessarily open) to other services within the agent environment. If one or more ports are provided, `dnsRecord` is automatically set to true. |
| services.default.readinessProbe | object | `{}` | A probe which is used to determine when the container is ready to accept. traffic. |
| services.default.resources | object | see [templates/services.yaml](./templates/services.yaml) | Resource requests and limits for the container. |
| services.default.runtimeClassName | string | `nil` | The container runtime e.g. gvisor or runc. When unset or `null`, the default depends on `networkPolicyProvider`: `gvisor` for `cilium`; for `ovn` `runtimeClassName` is omitted so the cluster default runtime (e.g. `crun` on cri-o/OpenShift, which has no gvisor RuntimeClass) is used. Set to the magic string `CLUSTER_DEFAULT` to force omission regardless of provider. |
| services.default.securityContext | object | `{}` | Privilege and access control settings for the container. |
| services.default.tolerations | list | `[]` | Toleration settings for the Pod. |
| services.default.volumeMounts | list | `[]` | Volume mounts that will be mounted in the container. Volumes defined in `volumes:` as colon-separated strings will automatically be mounted at their specified mount paths. |
| services.default.volumes | list | `[]` | Volumes accessible to the container. Supports arbitrary yaml or colon-separated strings of the form `volume-name:/mount-path`. |
| services.default.workingDir | string | `nil` | The container's working directory. |
| volumes | object | `{}` | A dict of volumes to deploy within the agent environment as NFS-CSI PersistentVolumeClaims. These volumes can be mounted in services using the `volumes:` field. The actual volume name will include the release name. |
